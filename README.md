# BIMM143_Project2_Python
This is my Project 2 for Bioinformatics. It focuses on the surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza type A H1N1. 

To adequately run the code found in my Jupyter notebook, you must have the following files:

  Project2_ProteinSequences.fasta
  
  aligned.fasta
  
  muscle.exe


>The protein sequences for HA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/BAA01280.1?report=fasta) and NA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/ADC45738.1?report=fasta) were both found on the NCBI database. NCBI is the National Center of Biotechnology Information and, according to their website, "advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information" The protein sequence for S was found on the Uniprot Knowledgebase database (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0DTC2). Uniprot is the Universal Protein Resource and, according to their website, "is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data." Upon downloading all three FASTA files, the files were all merged into one, larger FASTA file (Project2_ProteinSequences.fasta) containing all three protein sequences. The file aligned.fasta was obtained using an online tool found here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolresult.ebi?jobId=muscle-I20211208-061615-0558-22822573-p1m. muscle.exe was downloaded from https://github.com/rcedgar/muscle/releases/tag/v5.0.1428.
